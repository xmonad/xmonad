# Name

xmonad - Tiling Window Manager

# Description

_xmonad_ is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be
dynamically reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to
maximize the use of screen real estate. All features of the window manager
are accessible purely from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.
_xmonad_ is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be
implemented by the user in config files. A principle of _xmonad_ is
predictability: the user should know in advance precisely the window
arrangement that will result from any action.

By default, _xmonad_ provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide and
fullscreen. In tall or wide mode, windows are tiled and arranged to prevent
overlap and maximize screen use. Sets of windows are grouped together on
virtual screens, and each screen retains its own layout, which may be
reconfigured dynamically. Multiple physical monitors are supported via
Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of a number of screens.

By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich
static type system, _xmonad_ provides a complete, featureful window manager
in less than 1200 lines of code, with an emphasis on correctness and
robustness. Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a
combination of static guarantees provided by the type system, and
type-based automated testing. A benefit of this is that the code is simple
to understand, and easy to modify.

# Usage

_xmonad_ places each window into a "workspace". Each workspace can have
any number of windows, which you can cycle though with mod-j and mod-k.
Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or tiled
vertically. You can toggle the layout mode with mod-space, which will cycle
through the available modes.

You can switch to workspace N with mod-N. For example, to switch to
workspace 5, you would press mod-5. Similarly, you can move the current
window to another workspace with mod-shift-N.

When running with multiple monitors (Xinerama), each screen has exactly 1
workspace visible. mod-{w,e,r} switch the focus between screens, while
shift-mod-{w,e,r} move the current window to that screen. When _xmonad_
starts, workspace 1 is on screen 1, workspace 2 is on screen 2, etc. When
switching workspaces to one that is already visible, the current and
visible workspaces are swapped.

## Flags

xmonad  has  several flags which  you may pass to the executable.
These flags are:

--recompile
:   Recompiles your _xmonad.hs_ configuration

--restart
:   Causes the currently running _xmonad_ process to restart

--replace
:   Replace the current window manager with xmonad

--version
:   Display version of _xmonad_

--verbose-version
:   Display detailed version of _xmonad_

## Default keyboard bindings

___KEYBINDINGS___

# Examples

To use xmonad as your window manager add to your _~/.xinitrc_ file:

> exec xmonad

# Customization
xmonad is customized in your _xmonad.hs_, and then restarted with mod-q.
You can choose where your configuration file lives by

  1. Setting `XMONAD_DATA_DIR,` `XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR`, and
     `XMONAD_CACHE_DIR`; _xmonad.hs_ is then expected to be in
     `XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR`.
  2. Creating _xmonad.hs_ in _~/.xmonad_.
  3. Creating _xmonad.hs_ in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.  Note that, in this
     case, xmonad will use `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for its
     data and cache directory respectively.

You can find many extensions to the core feature set in the xmonad-
contrib package, available through your  package  manager  or  from
[xmonad.org].

## Modular Configuration
As of _xmonad-0.9_, any additional Haskell modules may be placed in
_~/.xmonad/lib/_ are available in GHC's searchpath. Hierarchical modules
are supported: for example, the file
_~/.xmonad/lib/XMonad/Stack/MyAdditions.hs_ could contain:

```haskell
module XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions (function1) where
  function1 = error "function1: Not implemented yet!"
```

Your xmonad.hs may then import XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions as if that
module was contained within xmonad or xmonad-contrib.
