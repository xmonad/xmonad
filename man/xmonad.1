xmonad - Tiling Window Manager
.SH Description
.PP
\f[I]xmonad\f[R] is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in
Haskell.
Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be
dynamically reconfigured.
At any time windows are arranged so as to maximize the use of screen
real estate.
All features of the window manager are accessible purely from the
keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.
\f[I]xmonad\f[R] is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms
may be implemented by the user in config files.
A principle of \f[I]xmonad\f[R] is predictability: the user should know
in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any
action.
.PP
By default, \f[I]xmonad\f[R] provides three layout algorithms: tall,
wide and fullscreen.
In tall or wide mode, windows are tiled and arranged to prevent overlap
and maximize screen use.
Sets of windows are grouped together on virtual screens, and each screen
retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamically.
Multiple physical monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing
simultaneous display of a number of screens.
.PP
By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a
rich static type system, \f[I]xmonad\f[R] provides a complete,
featureful window manager in less than 1200 lines of code, with an
emphasis on correctness and robustness.
Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a
combination of static guarantees provided by the type system, and
type-based automated testing.
A benefit of this is that the code is simple to understand, and easy to
modify.
.SH Usage
.PP
\f[I]xmonad\f[R] places each window into a \[lq]workspace\[rq].
Each workspace can have any number of windows, which you can cycle
though with mod-j and mod-k.
Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or tiled
vertically.
You can toggle the layout mode with mod-space, which will cycle through
the available modes.
.PP
You can switch to workspace N with mod-N.
For example, to switch to workspace 5, you would press mod-5.
Similarly, you can move the current window to another workspace with
mod-shift-N.
.PP
When running with multiple monitors (Xinerama), each screen has exactly
1 workspace visible.
mod-{w,e,r} switch the focus between screens, while shift-mod-{w,e,r}
move the current window to that screen.
When \f[I]xmonad\f[R] starts, workspace 1 is on screen 1, workspace 2 is
on screen 2, etc.
When switching workspaces to one that is already visible, the current
and visible workspaces are swapped.

.SH Examples
.PP
To use xmonad as your window manager add to your
\f[I]\[ti]/.xinitrc\f[R] file:
.RS
.PP
exec xmonad
.RE
.SH Customization
.PP
xmonad is customized in your \f[I]xmonad.hs\f[R], and then restarted
with mod-q.
You can choose where your configuration file lives by
.IP "1." 3
Setting \f[C]XMONAD_DATA_DIR,\f[R] \f[C]XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR\f[R], and
\f[C]XMONAD_CACHE_DIR\f[R]; \f[I]xmonad.hs\f[R] is then expected to be
in \f[C]XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Creating \f[I]xmonad.hs\f[R] in \f[I]\[ti]/.xmonad\f[R].
.IP "3." 3
Creating \f[I]xmonad.hs\f[R] in \f[C]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R].
Note that, in this case, xmonad will use \f[C]XDG_DATA_HOME\f[R] and
\f[C]XDG_CACHE_HOME\f[R] for its data and cache directory respectively.
.PP
You can find many extensions to the core feature set in the xmonad-
contrib package, available through your package manager or from
xmonad.org (https://xmonad.org).
.SS Modular Configuration
.PP
As of \f[I]xmonad-0.9\f[R], any additional Haskell modules may be placed
in \f[I]\[ti]/.xmonad/lib/\f[R] are available in GHC\[cq]s searchpath.
Hierarchical modules are supported: for example, the file
\f[I]\[ti]/.xmonad/lib/XMonad/Stack/MyAdditions.hs\f[R] could contain:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
module XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions (function1) where
  function1 = error \[dq]function1: Not implemented yet!\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Your xmonad.hs may then import XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions as if that
module was contained within xmonad or xmonad-contrib.
.SH Bugs
.PP
Probably.
