                    xmonad : a tiling window manager

                           http://xmonad.org

    xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
    automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
    screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the
    keyboard: a mouse is optional. xmonad is written, configured and
    extensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and
    other extensions may be written by the user in config files. Layouts
    are applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
    workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled
    on several physical screens.

Building:

 Building is quite straightforward, and requries a basic Haskell toolchain.
 On many systems xmonad is available as a binary package in your
 package system (e.g. on debian or gentoo). If at all possible, use this
 in preference to a source build, as the dependency resolution will be
 simpler.

 We'll now walk through the complete list of toolchain dependencies.

 * GHC: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
  
    You first need a Haskell compiler. Your distribution's package
    system will have binaries of GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler), the 
    compiler we use, so install that first. If your operating system's
    package system doesn't provide a binary version of GHC, you can find
    them here:

        http://haskell.org/ghc

    For example, in Debian you would install GHC with:

        apt-get install ghc6

    It shouldn't be necessary to compile GHC from source -- every common 
    system has a pre-build binary version.

 * X11 libraries:

    Since you're building an X application, you'll need the C X11
    library headers. On many platforms, these come pre-installed. For
    others, such as Debian, you can get them from your package manager:

        apt-get install libx11-dev

    Typically you need: libXinerama libXext libX11

 * Cabal
 
    xmonad requires a recent version of Cabal, >= 1.2.0. If you're using
    GHC 6.8, then it comes bundled with the right version. If you're
    using GHC 6.6.x, you'll need to build and install Cabal from hackage
    first:

          http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/Cabal

    You can check which version you have with the command:

        $ ghc-pkg list Cabal
        Cabal-1.2.2.0

 * Haskell libraries: mtl, unix, X11

    Finally, you need the Haskell libraries xmonad depends on. Since
    you've a working GHC installation now, most of these will be
    provided. To check whether you've got a package run 'ghc-pkg list
    some_package_name'. You will need the following packages:

    mtl   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mtl-1.0
    unix  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/unix-2.0 
    X11   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/X11-1.3.0

 * Build xmonad: 

    Once you've got all the dependencies in place (which should be
    straightforward), build xmonad:

        runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup.lhs build
        runhaskell Setup.lhs install --user

    And you're done!

Notes for using the darcs version

    If you're building the darcs version of xmonad, be sure to also
    use the darcs version of the X11 library, which is developed
    concurrently with xmonad.

        darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/X11

    Not using X11 from darcs is the most common reason for the
    darcs version of xmonad to fail to build.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running xmonad:

    Add:

         $HOME/bin/xmonad

    to the last line of your .xsession or .xinitrc file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring:

    See the CONFIG document

XMonadContrib

    There are many extensions to xmonad available in the XMonadContrib
    (xmc) library. Examples include an ion3-like tabbed layout, a
    prompt/program launcher, and various other useful modules.
    XMonadContrib is available at:

        0.5 release:   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad-contrib-0.5

        darcs version: darcs get http://code.haskell.org/XMonadContrib
